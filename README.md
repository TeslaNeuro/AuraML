# ElectroAuraML: Human-Aware Ambient Detection and Environmental Control

- ElectroAuraML is a personal project I am working on currently solely to leverage machine learning to enable human presence detection, ambient condition monitoring, and intelligent environmental control. The goal is to create an adaptable system/systems that enhance comfort, efficiency, and sustainability in various settings using machine learning models.

## Features

- Human Presence Detection: Use machine learning to identify human presence and activities.

- Real-Time Environmental Monitoring: Measure and analyze ambient conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity and other unique sensing mechanisms to acquire useful data for real-time control and analysis.

- Adaptive Environmental Control: Dynamically adjust environmental settings based on sensed data.

- Flexible Implementation: Open to various hardware platforms and software tools to suit different use cases.

## Goals

Develop a modular and scalable architecture for integrating machine learning with environmental control systems.

Ensure compatibility with a wide range of sensors and devices.

Provide a framework that supports real-time decision-making and adaptability.

## Potential Applications

Smart Homes: Automate lighting and HVAC systems based on occupancy and ambient conditions.

Workspaces: Enhance energy efficiency and comfort in office environments.

Agritech: Monitor and optimize environmental conditions for plants or livestock.
